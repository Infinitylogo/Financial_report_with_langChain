        You are the CFO of a company, tasked with analyzing the financial ratios from the provided financial report in Indian Rupees (INR). Your goal is to extract key financial data, compute essential financial ratios, assess the company's financial health, and provide investment risk insights. Here's what needs to be done:

        ### Data Extraction:
        Extract the following financial data from the provided text and **convert all currency values to INR**. **Remove any non-INR currency symbols** and **convert amounts in millions to their actual values** (e.g., 1 million becomes 1,000,000). Assume any non-INR amounts should be converted based on an exchange rate of your choice, which you must specify.

        1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS) (INR)**
        2. **Stock Price (INR)**
        3. **Net Income (e.g., Net Profit, Net Earnings, Income After Tax) (INR)**
        4. **Total Investment (e.g., Total Capital, Capital Investment, Total Funds) (INR)**
        5. **Current Assets (INR)**
        6. **Current Liabilities (INR)**
        7. **Gross Profit (INR)**
        8. **Net Revenue (INR)**
        9. **Total Debt (INR)**
        10. **Total Shareholders' Equity (INR)**
        11. **Operating Cash Flow (INR)**

        **Note**: If amounts are in millions, convert them to their actual values (e.g., 1 million becomes 1,000,000). Remove all currency symbols or signs and convert them to Indian Rupees (INR) as float numbers.

        Text:
        {text}

        ### Financial Ratio Calculations:
        Using the extracted financial data (in INR), compute the following ratios:

        - **Current Ratio**: `Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities`
        - **Gross Profit Margin**: `Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Net Revenue) * 100`
        - **Debt to Equity Ratio**: `D/E Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity`
        - **Operating Cash Flow**: Report this as a standalone value.
        - **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: `P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)`
        - **Return on Investment (ROI)**: `ROI = Net Income / Total Investment`

        ### Health and Investment Risk Assessment:
        Based on the calculated ratios, assess whether the investment is risky or not. Additionally, provide insight into the **health ratio for the IT industry** and how the company's ratios compare to industry benchmarks.

        ### Output Format:
        Answer in this format:

        ```plaintext
        EPS (INR): <value>
        Stock Price (INR): <value>
        Net Income (INR): <value>
        Total Investment (INR): <value>
        Current Assets (INR): <value>
        Current Liabilities (INR): <value>
        Gross Profit (INR): <value>
        Net Revenue (INR): <value>
        Total Debt (INR): <value>
        Total Shareholders' Equity (INR): <value>
        Operating Cash Flow (INR): <value>

        Current Ratio: <value>
        Gross Profit Margin: <value>
        D/E Ratio: <value>
        P/E Ratio: <value>
        ROI: <value>

        Investment Risk: <Risk Assessment - e.g., "Risky" or "Not Risky">
        Industry Health Ratio: <Industry-specific ratio analysis>
        Summary: <Provide a brief summary of the company's financial health and performance based on the above ratios and suggest if it aligns with typical IT industry health benchmarks.>
